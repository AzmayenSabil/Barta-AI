# Bangla Speech-to-Text Pipeline with Meeting Analysis

This architecture outlines a comprehensive solution for processing Bangla audio files and extracting meaningful information from meeting transcriptions.

## 1. Audio Upload & Validation Layer
- **Audio Upload**: Users upload audio files (e.g., MP3, WAV, M4A).
- **Audio Validation**: 
  - Validates the uploaded file for size, format, and quality (bitrate, sample rate, channels).
- **Audio Quality Check**: Ensures the uploaded audio meets the necessary standards for processing.

## 2. Audio Preprocessing Pipeline
- **Audio Segmentation**: 
  - Splits long recordings into smaller, manageable segments (15-30 seconds).
  - Removes silent periods.
- **Noise Reduction**: 
  - Applies adaptive noise reduction techniques to improve audio quality.
- **Speech Enhancement**: 
  - Uses spectral subtraction to reduce background noise.
- **Format Conversion**: 
  - Converts the audio to a standard 16kHz mono WAV format (if necessary).

## 3. ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition)
- **Primary ASR Model**: 
  - **Option 1**: Fine-tune the Whisper model on Bangla data.
  - **Option 2**: Use a custom ASR model (e.g., Wav2Vec 2.0 or Conformer) trained on Bangla speech.
  - **Option 3**: Google Speech To Text (Free Trial).
- **Speaker Diarization**: 
  - Segments the audio by speaker and labels the transcribed text accordingly.

## 4. Post-processing Pipeline
- **Text Normalization**: 
  - Handles special characters, numbers, and ASR errors.
- **Language Model Correction**: 
  - Implements a Bangla-specific language model to handle domain-specific terms and grammatical errors.

## 5. Analysis Layer
- **Text Summarization**: 
  - Extracts key discussion points and generates concise summaries.
- **Action Items Detection**: 
  - Identifies tasks, deadlines, and responsibilities from the transcript.
- **Speaker Attribution**: 
  - Matches each part of the transcript to the respective speaker.

## 6. Storage & Database Design
### Database
Stores processed data including:
- **Meetings**: Information about each meeting (e.g., ID, duration, status).
- **Transcripts**: Full transcriptions, including their processed status.
- **Speakers**: Speaker labels and corresponding speaking segments.
- **Action Items**: Tasks identified during the meeting, with assignee and due date.
